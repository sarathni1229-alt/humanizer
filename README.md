## 🛠️ Deployment  

### 📌 **Deploying on Streamlit Cloud**  
1. Push your repo to GitHub.  
2. Ensure `setup.sh` is in the repo root.  
3. Link your **GitHub repo** to **Streamlit Cloud** & specify `main.py` as the entry point.  
4. Streamlit Cloud will handle the deployment automatically.  

### 🚀 **Deploying on Vercel**
1. Ensure your repository contains a `vercel.json` file in the root, configured for a Python runtime.
2. Push your repo to GitHub.
3. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign up or log in.
4. Click 'Add New...' -> 'Project' and import your GitHub repository.
5. Vercel will detect the `vercel.json` file and attempt to deploy your application.
6. Note: Due to Streamlit being a long-running server and Vercel's primary focus on serverless functions,
   direct deployment of Streamlit apps on Vercel might require a custom Dockerfile or other advanced configurations for optimal performance and stability.
